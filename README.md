# AI Agent for Automated LinkedIn Image Posting 🚀<br>

I built an AI Agent that automatically generates and publishes **image posts on LinkedIn** using **MCP workflows, Pipedream, Gmail & LinkedIn integrations**.<br>
This project was built during the **MCP Mega Workshop by NxtWave**, where I learned how AI agents interact with real-world tools and automate workflows end-to-end.<br>

## 🔥 Features<br>

- Generates LinkedIn post content using AI<br>
- Automatically creates image posts<br>
- Publishes directly to LinkedIn<br>
- Gmail + LinkedIn + MCP tool integrations<br>
- Fully automated workflow pipeline<br>

## 🛠 Tech Stack<br>

- Python  <br>
- MCP Servers  <br>
- Pipedream  <br>
- Cursor IDE  <br>
- REST APIs  <br>
- Automation Workflows<br>  

## 🧠 How It Works<br>

1. User provides input text  <br>
2. AI agent processes and formats content  <br>
3. Image is generated  <br>
4. MCP workflow triggers LinkedIn posting  <br>
5. Post is automatically published  <br>
